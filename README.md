# My Front End Journey: JavaScript Basics

Welcome to the third stage of my front-end journey!  
With HTML giving me structure and CSS giving me style, now it’s time to give my pages a heartbeat using <a href="https://github.com/dedekharisma/my-frontend-journey">**JavaScript**</a>—the language that makes the web come alive.

## What I'm Learning Here

- **JavaScript fundamentals**: Variables, data types, operators, and writing my first code.
- **Functions**: Grouping code into reusable blocks.
- **Control flow**: Using `if`, `else`, and loops to control what happens and when.
- **DOM manipulation**: Selecting and changing HTML elements dynamically.
- **Events**: Listening and responding to clicks, typing, and other actions.
- **Working with data**: Understanding arrays and objects.
- **Mini projects**: Button counters, color switchers, and simple calculators.

## What's Inside

- `index.html`: A test page for running my scripts.
- `style.css`: Optional styling so my examples look nice.
- `script.js`: Where all the JavaScript action happens.
- `README.md`: You’re reading it right now.

## How I'm Using This

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to run the JavaScript.
3. Edit `script.js` to test new ideas and concepts.

## Why This Matters to Me

If HTML is the bones and CSS is the skin, JavaScript is the mind.  
It lets me create websites that *respond*, *change*, and *interact* with the user in real time.

## What's Next in My Journey

From here, I’ll dive deeper into **advanced DOM manipulation**, **modern JavaScript (ES6+)**, and eventually, **front-end frameworks** like React.
